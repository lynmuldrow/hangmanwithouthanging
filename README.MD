Hangman Without Hanging
==============================================

# A peaceful version of an ugly game.

Hangman is an offensive, triggering game making light of a punishment given to my ancestors for the color of their skin and nothing more. If you take the whole lynching part out, it's a pretty fun game. Hence, Hangman Without Hanging.

## How to play Hangman Without Hanging

To play, simply type in a letter and click "Guess". You'll have 6 guesses to uncover a dictionary word. Your incorrect previous guesses will show in red below the guess dialogue, correct guesses in grey. To win, correctly guess the word before running out of guesses. 



## Tech Stack 
There's no back end for this implementation, because none was necessary. Pure HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery. 


## What's next? 

This version of the game is currently nonworking in Chrome, based on a CORS issue blocking a connection to the given API. If I swap APIs to another dictionary, it works fine. I've tried the following fixes to make the given api work: 

-Disabled CORS in Chrome
-added testing extensions 

I will continue to test and implement a fix that makes sense for the project. I am excited to continue building this version, adding more zen elements and maybe adding a timer. A persisting high score sounds like fun, too!
